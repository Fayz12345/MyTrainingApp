# Android QA Build Trigger

This file is created to trigger the Android QA build workflow.

Timestamp: 2025-09-22 (Android build test)

## Expected Workflows to Run:
1. QA Deployment (admin portal) - should work âœ…
2. Android APK Build for QA - this is what we're testing
3. Simple Android Build - manual trigger available

## Notes:
- Local Android build has native module issues (common in dev environments)
- GitHub Actions provides cleaner build environment
- S3 deployment and admin portal are working successfully
